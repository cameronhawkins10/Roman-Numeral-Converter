# Roman Numeral Converter

## Overview
This project is a web-based Roman Numeral Converter that transforms Arabic numerals into Roman numerals. It was developed as part of the freeCodeCamp's curriculum to fulfill specific user stories and functionality similar to the reference project provided by freeCodeCamp.

The application provides a simple and intuitive user interface where users can input an Arabic numeral and receive its Roman numeral counterpart. The goal is to help users understand the relationship between modern numbers and their ancient symbolic representations.

## Technologies Used
- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript

## Features
The converter allows users to:
- Input Arabic numerals.
- Convert Arabic numerals to Roman numerals via a button click.
- View the Roman numeral result in a dedicated output area.

### User Stories Implementation
- The input element for entering numbers has an id of `"number"`.
- A button for initiating the conversion process has an id of `"convert-btn"`.
- A `div` element displays the conversion results and has an id of `"output"`.

Based on the input, the application correctly handles and displays messages for invalid inputs or results for valid numbers, such as converting 9 to `"IX"` and 3999 to `"MMMCMXCIX"`.

## What I Learned
Throughout the development of this project, I gained substantial insights and skills:
- **DOM Manipulation**: Learned to interact with the Document Object Model (DOM) to read input and dynamically update the content based on user interactions.
- **JavaScript Functions**: Enhanced my understanding of JavaScript functions and event handling, especially how to manage user events and process data.
- **Validation**: Implemented checks and error messages to guide the user experience and ensure reliable input processing.
- **CSS Styling**: Improved my CSS skills to provide a responsive and visually appealing user interface.

## Project Completion
This project was completed as part of the freeCodeCamp's curriculum, which provided structured guidelines and objectives. The experience helped solidify my front-end development skills and taught me valuable lessons in building functional, user-friendly web applications.
